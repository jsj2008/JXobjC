# JX Objective-C (*Marxist-Leninist*) Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
**JX Objective-C (*Marxist-Leninist*)** community, as well as steps to reporting
unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring
community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who
violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

## Expectations

Our open source community strives to:

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be communist**: JX Objective-C (*Marxist-Leninist*) is an explicitly Communist
  project. Political belief is not a protected characteristic; our tolerance is
  not unprincipled. We will not tolerate the right, the present state of affairs
  in computing and the world, or opposition to socialism.
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people
  of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members
  of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,
  social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
  identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, and mental or
  physical ability.
- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not
  be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be respectful**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be prudent in the words that we choose**: we are a community of
  communists, and we conduct ourselves in a manner conducive to the commune. Be
  kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and
  other exclusionary behaviours aren't acceptable.
- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength
  of our community comes from its diversity: the contributions of people from a
  wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
  issues.
  Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re
  wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get
  us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
  mistakes.


## Definitions

Behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission

We will not act on complaints made by known fascists, holocaust denialists, or
anti-migrant activists.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation
of the project is subject to definition by the project maintainers.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at the JX Objective-C issues page. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.


## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly
and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect
them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is
our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right
the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the
protected characteristics above.
