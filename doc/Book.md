#### Rationale ####
This book-in-progress collates in one location information on the Objective-C
*(JX)* programming language, hereby abbreviated **JXobjC**. It additionally
describes JX Objective-C, the reference implementation of JXobjC. 

I have aimed to produce in this book a reference suitable for those new to
JXobjC, but also for those who do know it. The chapters outline the 'what' and
the 'how'. For the 'why', please see the supplement on the philosophy of JXobjC.
Find it [here](Philsphy.md).

It may be prudent to read that treatise in order to understand the approach used
in the design of JXobjC, which places centrefield an ideology of emancipation,
of freedom from fear. A microcosm of communism in the world of bytes. Because
JXobjC is in fact an extension of the C programming language, only minimal
attention is granted to the imperative-procedural metaphysic of C in which
JXobjC builds its own reality. Refer to the C11 standard (*ISO/IEC 9899:2011*)
for such details.
