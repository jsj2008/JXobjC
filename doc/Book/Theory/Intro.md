### Introduction to Objective-C *(JX)* and Its Implementation `jxobjc`

Welcome! I (David MacKay), the author of Objective-C *(JX)* (abbreviated 
*JXobjC*) and the maintainer of the reference implementation JX Objective-C
(abbreviated `jxobjc`; note the code tag and lower-casing) have sought to
compile a one-stop-shop reference and manual, useful for both those who are
already familiar with the language and compiler but also for those new to it.
This book has a supplement, ["The Philosophy of the Programming Language
Objective-C *(JX)*"](../../Philsphy.md), which is linked.

JXobjC is a modern systems and apps programming language built atop the
Objective-C language pioneered by Stepstone, NeXT, and Apple. It is an
iconoclastic language: it is guided by the lessons of social fields -
critical theory, psychoanalysis, sociology, and psychology - just as much as it
is by traditional programming language theory. The aim is to build a language
where one does not write **code**, but instead, describes objects and how they
should interact with each other. It is *the abolition of coding*. You can find
further details, if you are interested, in the philosophy supplement linked in
the first paragraph.

The book is divded into three parts - theory, praxis, and implementation - and
an appendix.
