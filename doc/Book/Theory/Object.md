### The autonomous Object

>*The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
behaviors should be.*
>> - Dr. Alan Kay (OOP pioneer and inventor of SmallTalk)

You are at the supermarket buying your weekly messages. You notice that your
favoured brand of tea is out of stock, but you go ahead anyway and bring your
shopping to the counter. You note while the checkout assistant is scanning your
goods that your favourite brand of tea was not in stock; they tell you that they
will try to make sure it's in stock for next week.

What made it possible for you to retrieve your essentials in this simple way? In
a word, society, the composite social interactions of all humanity. Everyone
plays their own role, however small, in this process. Each communicates with the
others in order that everything should continue running smoothly. The checkout
assistant speaks to the manager, who asks the bulk distributor to include more
of the relevant brand of tea, who asks the producers for some.

This is the object-orientation in a nutshell. It is programming according to the
same rules that we live by in human society. When you go to the supermarket, you
need understand nothing about the logistics of it, nor of how it's managed. You
simply find what you'd like to buy and pay for it.

In the object-oriented programme, too, need you not know the intricacies of the
logic behind what happens. That being said, it remains useful to understand
these things. But the central idea here is what's known as *encapsulation*. The
Objects store within them all the complexities of how they work, and any
information they need to keep. Other Objects do not open the Object and inspect
within it; this is not acceptable in human interaction, neither is it here.
Instead, they communicate with the Object and ask it if it can do what it is
they'd like, and the Object will reply.

In another imitation of society, JXobjC has what is known as *classes*. Classes
represent a *class* of object.
